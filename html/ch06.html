<p>
    Libraries provide the means to package reusable pieces of Arduino
    Software.  You can create them yourself, or find libraries on the
    Internet.  You can leave them as is, or (subject to licenses)
    modify them to suit your own purposes.
  </p>
<p>
    Using libraries with dno is about as easy as it gets.  Dno:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
	automatically discovers what libraries you want to use;
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	allows local copies of libraries to take precedence over
	standard system libaries;
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	allows libraries to be unit tested on the host system;
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	allows libraries to be documented using Doxygen.
      </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
    All of this means that <code class="literal">dno</code> can be used to build
    professional-quality, well-tested, and well-documented code, which
    you can be proud of sharing with the world.

<a name="idm755"></a>6.1.1. Setting Up</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	In <a class="link" href="ch03.html#getting_started" title="3.1. Creating The Project Directory">Getting Started</a>, we
	created a <code class="literal">blink</code> project, and created the
	sketch <code class="literal">blink.ino</code>.
      </p>
<p>
	Then in <a class="link" href="ch04.html#board_type" title="4.3.  The BOARD_TYPE File, And Board Types">
      The BOARD_TYPE File, And Board Types
    </a> section we suggested that using
	board-specific subdirectories was the preferred way to use
	dno.
      </p>
<p>
	So, after running <code class="literal">dno pristine</code>, we have a
	directory system that looks like this:
	</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
blink$ ls -l
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1233 Jan  6 11:04 blink.ino
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 12 11:30 pro.8MHzatmega328
blink$ ls -l pro.8MHzatmega328/
total 0
blink$
	</pre>
<p>
      </p>
<p>
	That is, it contains our sketch file
	<code class="literal">blink.ino</code> and an empty board directory
	<code class="literal">pro.8MHzatmega328</code> (choose a board type that
	works for you).
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm769"></a>6.1.2. Wanting A Better Blink</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Our <code class="literal">blink.ino</code> sketch is a little too
	simple.  One of its problems is that the blink timing is
	handled by busy-wait delays.  This means that nothing else can
	be done while waiting to turn the LED on or off.  It also
	means that there will be some timing drift as each timeout
	starts a few cycles after the previous one.  It would be good
	to remedy these problems.
      </p>
<p>
	What we need is a non-blocking timer of some sort.  Let's take a
	look at the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/marcmunro/Deferal.git" target="_top">Deferal</a>
	library. 
      </p>
<p>
	Yep, looks promising.

<a name="idm776"></a>6.1.3. Installing the Deferal Library</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	On the github page for Deferal, there is a
	<code class="literal">Code</code> button.  Pressing this (in today's
	browser at least) gives us the url for a <code class="literal">git
	clone</code> operation.
      </p>
<p>
	Let's move to our project root directory and clone the
	library:
	</p>
<pre class="programlisting">

<p>
	Taking a look at the new library:

<p>
      </p>
<p>
	It looks like it comes with tests and documentation.  Let's
	see:

<p>
	Before we change the sketch to use Deferal objects, we'll
	refactor it.  This is to make it cleaner, easier to work with,
	and easier to subsequently change.  
      </p>
<p>
	Some of this is cosmetic and down to personal preferences but
	whatever your preferences are (or your coding standards
	require) it is better to make these changes now than being
	forced into a coding style you dislike, or worse still, ending
	up with conflicting styles throughout the code.
      </p>
<p>
	We'll start by removing most of the comments, which are
        currently not that helpful, and re-formatting to the author's
	preferred style.  Then we'll build again:

<pre class="programlisting">

<a name="idm818"></a>6.2. Unit Testing</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      Testing Arduino code can be difficult.
      </p>
<p>
      Generally you write the code, upload it, and see if it does what
      you expect.  If it doesn't then you have to reason about it, or
      maybe add some serial writes so that you can see what bits of
      code are actually being executed.
    </p>
<p>
      If you have code paths that you don't expect to normally be
      executed, testing them can be very difficult indeed.  Normally
      you have to change your code to make the rare case happen, try
      that modified code out, and then change the code back again.
      Which means that you are not testing the code that will actually
      run, and if you accidentally change something in that code path
      it may never get tested again.
    </p>
<p>
      The solution to this is to put as much code as possible into
      libraries as these can be unit-tested on your host computer.  If
      the library's unit tests are well designed, you should be able
      to test <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> code paths, no matter how
      unlikely to be triggered.  As a bonus, the tests also become
      automated and repeatable.
    </p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="unit_tests"></a>6.2.1. Unit Testing With Dno</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	When run in a library or its tests subdirectory, dno will
	attempt to create a file called
	<code class="literal">test_&lt;LIBNAME&gt;</code>.  This will be created
	by compiling the file
	<code class="literal">test_&lt;LIBNAME&gt;.cpp</code> or
	<code class="literal">test_&lt;LIBNAME&gt;.c</code>.  Having created the
	executable, it will then run it with no parameters.  It is
	assumed that if the executable completes with a success code,
	that the tests have passed.
      </p>
<p>
	Dno does not itself provide a unit-testing framework.
	Instead, any such framework needs to be included in the
	library's <code class="literal">tests</code> subdirectory.
      </p>
<p>
	One such suitable framework is 
	<a class="link" href="https://github.com/cppunit/cppunit.git" target="_top">CPlusPlusUnit</a>,
	which is very small and simple but provides just about all of
	the functionality you might need, though the documentation is
	a little sparse.  Check the Deferal library for examples of
	usage.

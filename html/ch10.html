<p>
      Dno was created out of frustration with the Arduino IDE.  In
      particular:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    its slowness;
	  </p>
<p>
	    The IDE is slow everywhere.  It's slow to start, slow to
	    compile, slow to do anything.
	  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    its clunkiness;
	  </p>
<p>
	    Everything about it is clunky.  The tiny edit window.  The
	    weird buttons.  The way that it always starts up halfway
	    between my 2 monitors.  The menu entries that look like
	    headings...
	  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    its attitude;
	  </p>
<p>
	    Here's how you write software: you bring up a really
	    crappy editor that has no interest in how you want to use
	    your filesystem and that does not have the power of the
	    tools that you normally use.  No, you can't use standard
	    tools.  And, no you can't build from the command line: well,
	    you can but the commands are insane.
	  </p>
<p>
	    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">But this is the right way to do it.  In fact it's
	    the only way.</span>”</span>
	  </p>
<p>
	    That's the attitude I'm talking about.  And it sucks.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Many IDEs have that attitude.  And many of their users
	    buy-in to it.  You will often hear the question,
	    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">why would you not use
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>whatever</em></span>?</span>”</span>, when the real
	    question should be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">why can't I use tools that I am
	    familiar with?</span>”</span>
	  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    its inflexibility.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The editor has no flexibility.  It is neither powerful nor
	    customisable.  It doesn't, by default, access your normal
	    files, and creates new files where <span class="emphasis"><em>it</em></span>
	    wants to, taking no account of the way you want your
	    directory structured.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The IDE provides no way to actually develop libraries.
	    You can write them, but you can't test them or document
	    them.  It's a toy development environment for toy
	    devlopment.
	  </p>

<p>
	So, I didn't like the IDE.  I tried using a proper editor and
	cutting and pasting my code into the IDE.  That sucked.
      </p>
<p>
	I know there are other IDEs, like eclipse, that maybe don't
	suck, but I still don't like IDEs.
      </p>
<p>
	I tried using the CLI.  But the commands are pure mental: way
	too many parameters.  That sucked.  Even with some moderately
	smart scripts to run it all.
      </p>
<p>
	I found <code class="literal">Arduino.mk</code>.  Finally, something that
	didn't suck.  It showed that normal tools like
	<code class="literal">make</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be used.
	But it was really stuck in the <code class="literal">avr</code> world,
	and it still required a bit too much hand-holding, particulary
	around library use.
      </p>
<p>
	I looked at hacking it, and discovered a lot about
	<code class="literal">make</code> that I didn't know.  It was a very
	good piece of work, but still not quite right.
      </p>
<p>
	I developed my own version of <code class="literal">Arduino.mk</code>
	that tackled some of the problems, but it still didn't feel
	right.  Copies of the makefile had to be put in place in each
	directory.  But library discovery worked pretty well.
      </p>
<p>
	It all came together when I was trying to parse the
	<code class="literal">platform.txt</code> file.  I finally realised that
	a simple transform could turn it into makefile syntax.  And
	then I discovered make's <code class="literal">eval</code> function and
	everything was suddenly possible.

    Dno can be installed by downloading and unpacking a release
    tarball or by cloning from <link

    Unless you want to hack on dno itself, installing from a tarball
    is the recommended option.

    <title>Compatibility</title>
    <para>
      Dno is expected to run on any Unix-like operating system: Linux,
      BSD, MacOSX.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is built using <acronym>GNU</acronym>
      <literal>autotools</literal>, so any OS supported by
      <literal>autotools</literal> should work.  It is unlikely that
      Windows(Tm) will ever be supported.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section><title>Dependencies</title>
  <para>
    Dno requires <literal>bash</literal>, <literal>make</literal>,
    <literal>sed</literal> and <literal>gawk</literal> in order to
    run.
  </para>
  <para>
    For building and installing dno, <literal>gcc</literal> is also
    required.
  </para>
  <para>
    To build documentation: <literal>pandoc</literal>,
    <literal>xsltproc</literal> and the docbook xslt stylesheets (v4)
    are required.  Tarball-based installations provide pre-built
    documentation so do not need these.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you want to modify dno, you should also install
    <literal>autotools</literal>.

	This determines where dno should be installed, among other

	If you happen to already have the tools installed that are
	needed for creating dno documentation, this step will build
	the documentation from source rather than using the
	distributed versions.  Either way, you will now be ready to
	install.

    <section>
      <title>Make Install</title>
      <para>
	Installation, needs to be done as root.  You can use
	<literal>sudo</literal> if you must
	<footnote xml:id='sudo-wassup'>
	  <para>
	    The big problem with sudo is that it is generally
	    configured to allow an unprivileged user to do
	    <emphasis>anything</emphasis> that root can do without the
	    need for any password other than your own.  What this
	    means is that your user password becomes the single means
	    of authentication for all administrative tasks.  If you
	    think this is unduly alarmist try typing
	    <programlisting>
~$ sudo su -	      
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Now you have a root shell.  You can do absolutely anything
	    at this point, with virtually no audit trail, and you
	    should be very concerned.  Sudo was designed to allow
	    non-root users to perform <emphasis>specific</emphasis>
	    privileged tasks.  In this mode of use it makes a lot of
	    sense and poses little risk.  Having sudo allow
	    <emphasis>anything</emphasis> should be regarded as poor
	    security practice.
	  </para>
	  </footnote>, or become root using <literal>su</literal> and
	  run <literal>make install</literal>:
	  <programlisting>
dno$ su
Password: 
dno# make install
Installing dno executables in /usr/local/bin
Install dno man pages in /usr/local/share/man
dno# exit
dno$
	  </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	That's it.  You are done.
      </para>
      <para>
	Note that if you install a new Arduino IDE after this, you
	should repeat the above installation steps.  This will ensure
	that dno can find the newly installed Arduino tools.

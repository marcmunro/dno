    <title>Creating The Project Directory</title>
    <para>
      Create a directory named after your project.  For our example,
      we'll call our project <quote>blink</quote>.
      <programlisting>
~$ mkdir blink
~$ cd blink	    
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      That's it.  It's no harder than that.  But to make this section
      more interesting, let's run <literal>dno</literal> in this
      directory:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno
make: Nothing to be done for 'unknown'.
blink$
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Here dno can't figure out what the right thing to do is, so
      does nothing.  Which is the right thing to do.
    </para>

    <title>Create An Initial Sketch</title>
    <para>
      Let's create a copy of the much-used
      <literal>blink.ino</literal> sketch.  You can use your favourite
      editor, or get it from github, or whatever.  You could even copy
      and paste it from below:
      <programlisting>
/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

  This example code is in the public domain.

*/

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Now our directory looks like this:
      <programlisting>
blink$ ls
blink.ino
blink$ 
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's run <literal>dno</literal> again:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno
Nothing to be done here (in /home/user/proj/blink).
Try dno ./BOARD_TYPE or dno tests
blink$ 
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      This tells us that dno does not know what sort of Arduino board
      to build for.  You can get more information about this using
      <literal>dno info</literal> or <literal>dno help</literal>.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Select Our Board</title>
    <para>
      We can tell dno what sort of board to build for by creating a
      <literal>BOARD_TYPE</literal> file.  The simplest way to do this
      is using dno's <literal>BOARD_TYPE</literal> <link
      linkend='targets'>target</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see what boards are available use <literal>dno
      show_boards</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's assume that we want to compile for a 3.3V Arduino pro
      mini.  Using <literal>show_boards</literal>, we find that that
      the board name for this is <quote>pro</quote>, and that there
      are 4 cpu options:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno show_boards BOARD=pro

    Supported ArduinoBoard and CPU Types
============================================================

  8MHzatmega328         ATmega328P (3.3V, 8 MHz)
blink$
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="create_board_type">
      We create our <literal>BOARD_TYPE</literal> file as follows:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno BOARD_TYPE BOARD=pro CPU=8MHzatmega328
  Creating BOARD_TYPE...
blink$ ls
blink.ino  BOARD_TYPE
blink$ 
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      We can see that dno has created a BOARD_TYPE file, which
      identifies the type of board that we are to compile for.
      Looking at it:
      <programlisting>
blink$ cat BOARD_TYPE
pro.8MHzatmega328
blink$ 
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      We see that it simply contains the board and cpu identification
      for our pro mini board.
    </para>

    <title>Compiling/Building</title>
    <para>
      Let's now run <literal>dno</literal> again and see what happens:

      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      From dno's output we can see that <literal>BOARD_INFO</literal>
      was created, and then a bunch of compilation and other commands
      were executed.  In addition to compiling the sketch
      <literal>blink.ino</literal>, the components of the
      <literal>core</literal> library were built, an archive file was
      built from those components (<literal>AR</literal>), the whole
      thing was linked together to create an executable
      (<literal>LD</literal>), and then, finally, a downloadable
      version of the executable was created
      (<literal>OBJCOPY</literal>).
    </para>
    <para>
      Note thet the dno output shows a sanitised version of what is
      actually being done.  This is mainly for aesthetic reasons:
      showing the full commands that are executed is pretty ugly.  But
      if that's what you want, you can (as shown <link
      linkend='VERBOSE'>here</link>) set <literal>VERBOSE</literal> on
      the command line: 
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno VERBOSE=y
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      From our directory listing we can also see that a
      <literal>build</literal> directory was created.  This is where
      all of our object, lib and executable files are created:
      <programlisting>
blink$ ls -l build

blink$ 
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that once everything is built, dno will not rebuild it
      unless something changes:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno
make: Nothing to be done for 'build'.
blink$
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the message says <literal>make:...</literal>.  This is
      because dno is <link linkend='dno_is_make'>implemented using
      <literal>make</literal></link>.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="upload">
    <title xml:id="upload.title" >Uploading To A Board</title>
    <para>
      Now we need to connect our Arduino device to our computer.
      Typically, this is through a USB connection.  Once done, we can
      verify that the device can be seen using <literal>dno
      devices</literal>:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno devices
DEVICES: /dev/ttyUSB0
blink$
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      This shows that a serial device is connected to
      <literal>/dev/ttyUSB0</literal>.  This is a good sign.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, as long as there is a single device connected, we should be
      able to upload our sketch:
      <programlisting>
blink$ dno upload
  Resetting device attached to (/dev/ttyUSB0)...

blink$

      Please note that the ridiculous verbosity of this is outside of
      dno's control.

  <section>
    <title>In Summary</title>
    <para>
      In summary, to create a brand new project, blink, from scratch,
      and upload it to an Arduino board takes only the following steps
      (dno output not shown):
      <programlisting>
~$ mkdir blink
~$ cd blink
blink$ [create blink.cpp using your favourite editor]
blink$ dno BOARD_TYPE BOARD=pro CPU=8MHzatmega328
[ . . . ]
blink$ dno
[ . . . ]
blink$ dno upload
[ . . . ]
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      It could hardly be more simple.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that if you were confident that
      <literal>blink.cpp</literal> would build without errors, you
      could even omit the build step: ie the step before the upload,
      as <literal>dno upload</literal> will automatically realise that
      compilation and linking is needed and will make it happen.

# dno
#### A system for building Arduino software

dno provides a command-line alternative to Arduino IDEs.  It is fast
and easy to use, and supports the creation of documentation and unit
tests, which the standard IDE does not.

Full documentation will be forthcoming, in the meantime check out the
various man pages in the man subdirectory.

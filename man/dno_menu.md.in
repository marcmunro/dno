# NAME

dno_menu - Manage Arduino board options for **dno**

# SYNOPSIS
 **dno_menu** [OPTIONS]

# DESCRIPTION

**dno_menu** allows a caller to change options for the currently
selected Arduino board type in a dno board directory.

With the **--menu** option (the default) selected **dno_menu**
allows the user to select from various options for each of the
optional build parameters for that board.  Any non-default values
that are selected for any option are written to the BOARD_OPTIONS
file.  If no non-default options are selected, this file will not be
written and will be deleted if present.

The **--list** option prints the currently selected options in a form
suitable for use in the Arduino "fqbn" property (see the 
Platform Specification for more details).

Note that the "cpu" option, eg for Arduino promini boards, is handled
separately and such options are not selectable through **dno_menu**.

This is part of the dno Arduino software builder package.

# OPTIONS

**-h, --help**

    Provide help.

**-l, --list**

    Generate a list of selected options in a format suitable for the
    "fqbn" Arduino Platform Specification property.  Do not present
    the user with any menus.

**-m, --menu**

    Interact with the user using menus, to allow them to choose
    various platform properties.  This is the default option for
    **dno_menu** so does not need to be explicitly provided.

**-v, --version**

    Print version information and exit

# EXIT STATUS

Returns success as long as nothing goes horribly wrong.

# FILES

The BOARD_INFO in the current directory is read and parsed in order
to identify the set of options for the currently selected Arduino
board.

The BOARD_OPTIONS file will be written to with the set of non-default
selected options.

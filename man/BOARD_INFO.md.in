# NAME

BOARD_INFO - file of Arduino properties in make(1) syntax

# DESCRIPTION
BOARD_INFO files are used by **dno**(1) to define all of the various
properties required in order to compile and build code for an Arduino
board, in make format.  This means that BOARD_INFO files can be
included into makefiles, which is exactly what **dno** does.

BOARD_INFO files are derived, primarily, from the Arduino
platform.txt and boards.txt files that are supplied with Arduino
software, though may also contain entries derived from a local
platform.local.txt file.

BOARD_INFO files are created by **dno_bpp**, which performs the
following operations on the incoming files:

  - header definitions are added to identify the source files, the
    host OS, and the dno version;

  - properties appearing on the right hand side of definitions are
    converted into makefile variables;

  - unused board definitions are filtered out;

  - default menu entries are identified;

  - undefined build paths are discovered and defined;

  - quotes appearing in quoted strings are escaped.
